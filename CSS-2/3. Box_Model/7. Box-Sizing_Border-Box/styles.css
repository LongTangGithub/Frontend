/* There is something annoying about the Box Model */
/* If someone were to ask what's the size of the div, you would probably state the defined set width and height */
/* However, that is wrong because you only accounting the content area of the div, not the padding and border */
/* Width:  300 + 24 + 24 + 5 + 5 = 358px */
/* Height: 100 + 24 + 24 + 5 + 5 = 158px */

/* box-sizing has two possible values: border-box or content-box */
/* content-box: Width and height apply "ONLY" to the content                 ----> Remains fixed                        */
/* border-box: Width and height "INCLUDE" the content, padding, and border   ----> Consistent sizing for easier layouts */
